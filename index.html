    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <pre>
Hi, I’m Daniel Wilkinson, and I go by the alias Kinso online. I’m currently studying an Associate Degree in Information Technology.

I’m highly competitive and motivated by challenge, always looking for ways to push myself and improve. I work well
in team environments and have experience contributing to focused, high-pressure discussions where clear communication matters.

I’m passionate about leadership and believe the most effective leaders set the standard through their actions.
